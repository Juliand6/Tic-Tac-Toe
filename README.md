Title: Tic Tac Toe

Description: 
In this project we will be building the classic game of Tic Tac Toe using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Tic Tac Toe is a simple game played on a three by three grid where each player's 
objective is to get three X’s or O’s lined up diagonally, in a row, or in a column. Our project will serve as a one player game, where the user will interact with 
the game by inputting a move followed by the server who will select a move by random until either the player wins, loses or creates a draw. The project will include a 
win streak tracker and a leaderboard that displays the users with the highest win streaks.
