Title: Tic Tac Toe

Description: 
In this project we will be building the classic game of Tic Tac Toe using HTML, CSS and Javascript. Tic Tac Toe is a simple game played on a three by three grid where each player's 
objective is to get three X’s or O’s lined up diagonally, in a row, or in a column. Our project will serve as a one player game, where the user will interact with 
the game by inputting a move followed by the server who will select a move by random until either the player wins, loses or creates a draw. If the user wins more than one game consecutively, the application will track the number of consecutive wins and record the final winstreak onto a leaderboard. There may also possibly be a 2 player option. There will also be a side function which allows users to search for and play spotify songs or playlists in the background as well as a weather dashboard which will tell users the weather outside based on the client's location. This will be done using a weather API and the spotify API.
