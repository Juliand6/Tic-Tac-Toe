            <h1>Rules:</h1>
            <p>Tic-Tac-Toe is a 2 player game in which both players take turns
                placing their corresponding game pieces in a 3 by 3 grid. The game
                ends and a player wins when either player manages to connect 3 of their
                game pieces in a row. A row can be defined as any of the conjugations
                of the following spaces on the grid: 123, 147, 258, 369, 456, 789, 159, 357 (refer to picture on the
                left).
                At the start of the game both players will be randomly assigned a symbol, either Os or Xs, this will
                be your corresponding symbol for the game. Player X will always make the first move, and player O will
                make the second.
            </p>
